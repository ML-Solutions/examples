### Description

The model is an improved version of the mean pooled model described in the
NAACL-HLT 2015 paper. It uses video frame features from the
[VGG-16](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8#file-readme-md)
layer model. This is trained only on the Youtube video dataset.

Please consider citing the above paper if you use this model.

### Performance

The METEOR score of this model is 27.7% on the Youtube (MSVD) video test dataset.
(refer to Table 2 in the [Sequence to Sequence - Video to Text
paper](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/papers/venugopalan.iccv15.pdf)).

### Caffe compatibility

The models are currently supported by the `recurrent` branch of the Caffe fork
by [Jeff Donahue](https://github.com/jdonahue/caffe.git) and
[Subhashini Venugopalan](https://github.com/vsubhashini/caffe.git), but are not yet
compatible with `master` branch of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/).

### Training

More details on the code and data can be found on this [Project
Page](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vsub/naacl15_project.html).
